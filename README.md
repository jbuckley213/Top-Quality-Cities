Looking to move to a new city but not sure how to chose? Why not let data make the decision for you! **_Top Quality Cities_** lets you search for any major city in the world and will show you the life quality data for that area. As well as a overrall score **_Top Quality Cities_** it will provide the individual rating for Housing, Startups, Tolerance, Environmental Quality and many more. Find your new city today!

**_Top Quality Cities_** has been developed as a part of the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/es/desarrollo-web/barcelona?utm_source=google-sea&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BCN_app_campus_brand_GA_ES&utm_term={keywords}&gclid=Cj0KCQjwo6D4BRDgARIsAA6uN19LKsx0pvTH-iUz-RfrGakzau9RGdhJaixWuX32X92njICzz66RYbAaAncuEALw_wcB) Web Developement bootcamp with the [Teleport](https://developers.teleport.org/api/) API and using JavaScript.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The **MVP** will include:
​

- **Homepage:** it will include all the links to navigate around the app and a link to the search page to access the city data.
- **City search page:** will include a search bar to find the city you would like to observe. The city will appear on the page with the rating system shown. :twisted_rightwards_arrows:
- **Sign Up:** A registration form for new users with email and password validation. :wave:
- **Log In:** A form for signed up users with email and password validation. :key:
- **About Us:** A brief descriptions on the goal we are trying to achieve **_Top Quality Cities_**, just press play. :play_or_pause_button:
  ​

## Backlog

- Have a carousel of main city on the homepage which the user can click and show the ratings straight away

- More strict password validation.

- Auto Complete in search bar

- Compare cities by specific attribites i.e. compares Dublin to Barcelona in terms of Housing

- Add a Log Out option once the user is logged and say "Hi, \${name}" on the navbar instead of having still the Log In and Sign Up options displayed.
